This task involves solving a regression problem related to predicting energy efficiency, specifically focused on analysing various building shapes with distinct features to estimate their heating load. The dataset contains information about different characteristics of buildings such as glazing area, glazing area distribution, orientation, and other relevant factors.

The dataset for this task included 9 features, denoted by X0, X1, ..., X8, and an outcome variable Y which needed to be predicted. The dataset contained missing values. Here is the meaning of the 10 variables:

* X0:  Category of the building
* X1: Relative Compactness
* X2: Surface Area
* X3: Wall Area
* X4: Roof Area
* X5: Overall Height
* X6: Orientation
* X7: Glazing Area
* X8: Glazing Area Distribution
* Y: Heating Load

Grade: 65% (Upper Second Class)
